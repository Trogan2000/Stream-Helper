## Hello There and thank you for checking out my Adhd Stream Helper

What does this do?
Click or Input a game and hit the magnafying glass to search for a Twitch Title, Twitch Notification, TikTok Live Title and Twitter Post

Why?
I have ADHD, Do you know how hard it is to focus on something?

No Seriously?
I Am being serious i wanted to make titles but wanted to make it easy on myself and my adhd, plus i didnt want to spoil any game

how long did this take?
12 months to have this working to my likes

did you code this mess?
HECK NO i received a base form code that i used as the base for the UI, then i got a video on how to add chatgpt to my twitch channel as a chatbot and well that became the search function.
Chatgpt and claude-3 both made it with a ton of arguing from myself


Will you add more to it? yes future me will be adding search function based on the platform selected (twitch will do twitch and twitter, tiktok would do tiktok and twitter, youtube would do youtube and twitter) i also want to add tag editing for twitch tags

will you add X? look suggest it i could always try
