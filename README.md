# ADHD Stream Helper

### What do I need?
- ADHD Stream Helper.sd
- Images - Used to show what platform the game is on (it works without this but ui doesnt like it)

### What does this do?
Select or input a game, then click the magnifying glass icon to use AI to generate:
- Twitch stream title
- Twitch notification
- TikTok Live title
- Twitter post

### Why did you create this?
As someone with ADHD, focusing on creating engaging titles and posts for multiple platforms can be challenging. This tool simplifies the process without spoiling game content.

### Development
- Time spent: 12 months to refine and perfect
- Coding: Based on existing UI code, integrated with ChatGPT for Twitch chatbot functionality
- AI assistance: Developed with input from ChatGPT and Claude-3, with my guidance and feedback

### Future plans

Platform-specific searches (e.g., Twitch will generate content for Twitch and Twitter)
Twitch tag editing functionality

### Feedback

Would you like me to explain any of the changes I made or provide additional suggestions?
